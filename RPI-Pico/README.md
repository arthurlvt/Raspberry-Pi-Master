# GETTING STARTED WITH RASPBERRY PI PICO

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **I used Raspberry Pi Pico to make this tutorial so it is possible that something changed in the meantime !**

# Hello Guys !
--> A few weeks ago, I decided to buy a Raspberry Pi Pico wich is a small programmable electronic board designed for electronics and embedded computing projects. In fact, I bought it especially to discover home automation !

# First, Download and Getting Started
1. Firstly, you need to install **MicroPython** wich is a light environment that allows you to easily write Python scripts to control the Pico. Then, it's perfect for beginners who want to explore GPIOs ! To do that, go on [**MicroPython.org**](https://micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO/) and download the [**last version**](https://micropython.org/resources/firmware/RPI_PICO-20241025-v1.24.0.uf2) of the Firmware.
   
2. When it's installed on your PC, take your Raspberry Pi Pico and follow the next instructions : First, press the **BOOTSEL Button** wich is on your RPI Pico and connect it to your PC at the same time with the a microUSB -> USB cable. Once done, if it worked, the **File Explorer** will start on your main screen and you will see the device will appear. ***For my part, it's called RPI-RP2*** Copy the file that you installed a few minutes before and paste it in the device. Then, unplug it and connect it again to restart it.

3. To use the Raspberry Pi Pico and code with it, your need to install an IDE. You should download [**Thonny**](https://thonny.org/) wich is the most used IDE to code in python with Raspberry Pi and also Raspberry Pico !

## Now, you're ready to code your first Program with your RPI-Pico !

--> Now, your environement is ready to start to use the Raspberry Pi Pico ! If you have any questions, you can contact me on discord **arthurlvt** or right it on your search bar on your browser : discord://-/users/490627367526465558 !
